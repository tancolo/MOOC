# Android MVP Practice
This project is the code of the [CSDN MOOC](http://edu.csdn.net/lecturer/course_list) (it has been taken down ðŸ˜Ÿ)

# The master branch is no longer updated, check the mvp-dev-more branch directly.

# What are the gains?

1. How to write the code with the MVP?
2. How to use the Rxjava to encapsulate the ShareSDK's callback as its own Observable, reducing unnecessary Handlers and callbacks.
3. How to access multiple different baseUrls with only one Retrofit instance.
4. How to use Android Behave to display and hide effects without using the third-party FAB.
5. How to share and login with ShareSDK?
6. How to make QQ login persistent without back server?
7. How to refactor the RecyclerView.Adapter.
8. A source code that can be used directly.

# Note
1. The master branch contains the code(lesson 1 - lesson 15).
2. The mvp-dev branch contains the code of all lessons.
3. The mvp-dev-more branch contains other new small features.
4. It is recommended to check and clone the mvp-dev-more branch, and Ishuying-1.0.apk has been compiled and generated based on this branch!
5. There are too many resource files in the master branch, it is not recommended to clone master directly. To view the latest code, please use the following method to obtain the mvp-dev-more branch code 
`git clone -b mvp-dev-more --single--branch https://github.com/tancolo/MOOC.git`
